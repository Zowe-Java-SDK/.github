GitHub location showcasing Java related applications and projects interacting with z/OS backend using [Zowe Java Client SDK](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-client-java-sdk).   

What is nice about z/OSMF Rest APIs, you can now write client-side applications that can interface with a z/OS backend instance without the need to compile and ftp over your program to the mainframe and execute locally. With the Rest APIs and the Zowe Java SDK which provides all the boilerplate code to make those API calls, you can easily now take advantage of the latest Java stack and pipelines to interface with z/OS on any client side OS with JVM.
