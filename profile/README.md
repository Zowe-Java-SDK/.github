GitHub location showcasing Java related applications and projects interacting with z/OS backend using [Zowe Java Client SDK](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-client-java-sdk).   

With z/OSMF Rest APIs in place on your z/OS instance, client-side applications can be written that interface with z/OS services without the need to compile and execute a program on z/OS or compiling a Jar on your client and ftp it to z/OS for execution there. With Rest APIs and the Zowe Java SDK which provides all the boilerplate code to perform those API calls, you can easily now take advantage of the latest Java stack and pipelines to interface with z/OS on any client side OS with JVM.   
  
z/OS services includes such things as submitting a job, creating a dataset or member, writing to a member or sequential dataset, monitoring a job's status and reporting on it completion, retrieving a job log and much more.
